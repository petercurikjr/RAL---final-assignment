# Shortest period finder algorithm (linear reccurence equations in F(2) field) 
This repository contains a program which, based on provided input, calculates shortest possible period for linear reccurence equations in finite F(2) field.

You can also read the final thesis (the `pdf` file in root folder) for the whole mathematical and algorithmical insight.

#### Website
You can try the algorithm on the [website](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) (in Slovak) to see how it works.

#### Desktop app
Written in Python with GUI library PyQT5. User interface remained unfinished, since the website implementation for the school subject's final assignment was sufficient.
